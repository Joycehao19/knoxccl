      <p>We are a new chapter of the Citizens' Climate Lobby established to
        focus on the impacts of climate change on the Greater Knoxville
        region, influences that touch each of us individually, effects that
        impact us collectively as a community, and shocks that range to the
        extents of the Earth. If you are interested in our beautiful East
        Tennessee environment, you are invited to attend our open meetings.
        You will be greeted respectfully independent of your political
        leanings, whether you are Republican, Democrat or Independent; if you
        believe that climate change is real or if you have doubts about its
        validity; whether you have abundant funds or have less; whether you
        are younger or older; <em>all</em> are welcome to the Greater
        Knoxville Citizens' Climate Lobby meetings.</p>

    <section id="about-ccl-tab" class="row col-md-12">

      <p>Citizens’ Climate Lobby is a nonprofit, nonpartisan, grassroots
        advocacy organization empowering people to experience breakthroughs
        exercising their personal and political power. Our chapter is just one
        of hundreds of chapters across the world working to create the
        political will for a livable world.</p>

      <p>We are laser-focused on a specific piece of legislation and a proven
        strategy to gain its passage. We are working for the passage of
        <a href="http://citizensclimatelobby.org/carbon-fee-and-dividend/">Carbon
        Fee and Dividend</a>, the climate change solution economists and
        climate scientists alike say is the “best first-step” to preventing
        the worst impacts of a warming world.</p>

      <p>Our market-based Carbon Fee and Dividend policy will drastically
        reduce emissions, create jobs, and support small businesses and
        families — all without growing government.</p>

      <p>We’ve seen firsthand how passionate citizens who are well-trained,
        organized by district and with a good system of support can more than
        influence the political process.</p>

    <h2>July 15, 2017</h2>

    <p><b>For those interested in improving the health of our environment.</b>
      If we individually strive to minimize our carbon footprints, we will
      have an influence. Regrettably, because all individuals will not, or
      cannot, minimize for numerous reasons, the totality of individual
      impacts probably will not significantly change our environment. To begin
      a rigorous attack on the problem, our population, the aggregate of
      individuals, must be offered an alternative to carbon utilization, one
      that is economically viable. The U. S., as the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions">number
        2 carbon emitter
      in the world</a>, must constrain fossil fuels before they arrive at the
      buyer level, and concurrently provide a fiscally responsible, achievable
      replacement. This is exactly the approach and single goal of our
      Citizens’ Climate Lobby. CCL has a solution, now the work begins,
      respectfully persuading skeptics and generating support. Please check
      out our website, <a href="https://knoxccl.org/">knoxccl.org</a>, connect
      with us, and help solve the carbon pollution problem.</p>

    <p><b>July Meeting.</b> Just a gentle reminder that the Citizens’ Climate
      Lobby will have an
      <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Citizens-Climate-Lobby-Knoxville/events/241288986/">informal
        Meet and Greet gathering</a> on Wednesday, July 19th, 7 pm, at the
        <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/C2jn18WFftD2">Earth Fare in Turkey Creek,
        10903 Parkside Drive, Knoxville</a>. Even if
        you cannot arrive at 7, please join us for a brief discussion, led by
        Don Kraus, CCL regional development director, probably starting about
        7:30.</p>

    <p><b>IMPORTANT. August News Item.</b> A Climate Advocate Training
      workshop will be offered by the Greater Knoxville Chapter of the
      Citizens’ Climate Lobby on Saturday, August 12, 9:00 am – 12 noon, on
      the University of Tennessee Agricultural Campus,
      <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/J5JxqUWw21A2">2500 EJ Chapman Drive</a>,
      Biosystems Engineering and Soil Sciences Bldg., Room 268. The session is
      free and will teach citizens the intricacies of building political will
      and affecting change in positive, constructive ways. Citizens’ Climate
      Lobby (CCL) has a unique approach of achieving change through building
      positive, respectful relationships with lawmakers and focusing on
      specific market-based, consumer-friendly solutions that have received
      support from conservatives and liberals alike. The workshop will include
      a mini-lobbying training.</p>
