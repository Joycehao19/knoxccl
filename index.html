      <p>We are a new chapter of the Citizens' Climate Lobby established to
        focus on the impacts of climate change on the Greater Knoxville
        region, influences that touch each of us individually, effects that
        impact us collectively as a community, and shocks that range to the
        extents of the Earth. If you are interested in our beautiful East
        Tennessee environment, you are invited to attend our open meetings.
        You will be greeted respectfully independent of your political
        leanings, whether you are Republican, Democrat or Independent; if you
        believe that climate change is real or if you have doubts about its
        validity; whether you have abundant funds or have less; whether you
        are younger or older; <em>all</em> are welcome to the Greater
        Knoxville Citizens' Climate Lobby meetings.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="about-ccl-tab" class="row col-md-12">

      <p>Citizens’ Climate Lobby is a nonprofit, nonpartisan, grassroots
        advocacy organization empowering people to experience breakthroughs
        exercising their personal and political power. Our chapter is just one
        of hundreds of chapters across the world working to create the
        political will for a livable world.</p>

      <p>We are laser-focused on a specific piece of legislation and a proven
        strategy to gain its passage. We are working for the passage of
        <a href="http://citizensclimatelobby.org/carbon-fee-and-dividend/">Carbon
        Fee and Dividend</a>, the climate change solution economists and
        climate scientists alike say is the “best first-step” to preventing
        the worst impacts of a warming world.</p>

      <p>Our market-based Carbon Fee and Dividend policy will drastically
        reduce emissions, create jobs, and support small businesses and
        families — all without growing government.</p>

      <p>We’ve seen firsthand how passionate citizens who are well-trained,
        organized by district and with a good system of support can more than
        influence the political process.</p>

    <h2>August 6, 2017</h2>

    <p><b>July Event Report.</b> Thanks to the talented group of folks that
      attended the Meet and Greet session on July 19, at the Earth Fare in
      Turkey Creek. The 27 people there appreciated the introductory
      information provided by our speaker, Don Kraus, CCL Field Development
      Coordinator, who drove in from Asheville for this occasion.  Thanks,
      Don, we welcome the encouragement and useful suggestions you made about
      activities of our Chapter. A encouraging event occurred when a meeting
      of a faith group, who were in an adjoining room, ended while we were
      still in session. Some came in, pulled up chairs, and were a most
      welcome addition.</p>

      <p><b>August 11 Community TV Climate Event.</b> Our Advocate Workshop
      leaders, national CCL representatives, Don Kraus, Field Development
      Coordinator, and Jim Tolbert, Conservative Outreach Director, will join
      Renee Hoyos, Executive Director of the Tennessee Clean Water Network, in
      a climate related television program, that will broadcast at 7:30 p.m.
      Friday August 11 on Community TV of Knox County.  Cable channels for
      Community TV of Knox County:  Comcast Channel 12; Charter Channel 193;
      Wow! Channel 6; ATT U-verse Channel 99.</p>

      <p><b>August 12 Climate Workshop Event.</b> Probably the most essential
      meeting of the year will occur on Saturday, August 12, The CCL Climate
      Advocate Workshop. The meeting time of the workshop is 9:00 am - 12:30
      pm at The University of Tennessee, Agricultural Campus, 2500 East J.
      Chapman Drive, Biosystems Engineering and Soil Sciences, Room 268. There
      will be free parking in Lot 66 and snacks will be provided. The training
      will be conducted by two national CCL representatives, Don Kraus, Field
      Development Coordinator, and Jim Tolbert, Conservative Outreach
      Director.</p>

      <p>The Workshop will include a brief introduction to climate change
      basics, Citizens’ Climate Lobby’s philosophy and details of how its
      solution, Carbon Fee and Dividend, works. We will identify the primary
      political levers necessary to help reduce the impact of fossil fuels on
      our environment – including lobbying, media relations, grassroots
      outreach, grasstops outreach and chapter development. Please be thinking
      about where your strengths will serve this worthy cause the best and be
      prepared to join a team that will focus on one of these political
      levers. Participants will learn and practice how to lobby, engage the
      media and give short “laser talks” on climate change solutions.</p>
      
      <p>This workshop is open to all interested in the health of our
      environment. Please join us if you are curious about what you as an
      individual can do, or about what a group of concerned people can
      accomplish. You are also welcome if you just need something to do on a
      Saturday morning, but we would like to know if you are coming. If you
      have not yet RSVP’d for this important program, please click
      <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/knoxville-tn-climate-advocate-training-workshop-tickets-36367398869">here</a>
      or go to: <a href="http://bit.ly/2h01I6u">http://bit.ly/2h01I6u</a>.
      Please share this with those in your network who you believe should
      attend.  If you cannot be there, then please come to our September
      meeting that will be on the 18th, 6:30 – 7:45 p. m. at the Bearden
      Public Library, where we will welcome new members who have joined us
      because of this training workshop.</p>

      <p><b>September 18 Monthly Meeting.</b> The Greater Knoxville Chapter of
      the Citizens’ Climate Lobby September meeting will be held on Monday,
      September 18, 6:30 – 7:45 p. m.  at the Bearden Public Library, 100
      Golfclub Rd, Knoxville TN. Agenda will be in the September
      Newsletter.</p>

    <h2>July 15, 2017</h2>

    <p><b>For those interested in improving the health of our environment.</b>
      If we individually strive to minimize our carbon footprints, we will
      have an influence. Regrettably, because all individuals will not, or
      cannot, minimize for numerous reasons, the totality of individual
      impacts probably will not significantly change our environment. To begin
      a rigorous attack on the problem, our population, the aggregate of
      individuals, must be offered an alternative to carbon utilization, one
      that is economically viable. The U. S., as the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions">number
        2 carbon emitter
      in the world</a>, must constrain fossil fuels before they arrive at the
      buyer level, and concurrently provide a fiscally responsible, achievable
      replacement. This is exactly the approach and single goal of our
      Citizens’ Climate Lobby. CCL has a solution, now the work begins,
      respectfully persuading skeptics and generating support. Please check
      out our website, <a href="https://knoxccl.org/">knoxccl.org</a>, connect
      with us, and help solve the carbon pollution problem.</p>

    <p><b>July Meeting.</b> Just a gentle reminder that the Citizens’ Climate
      Lobby will have an
      <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Citizens-Climate-Lobby-Knoxville/events/241288986/">informal
        Meet and Greet gathering</a> on Wednesday, July 19th, 7 pm, at the
        <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/C2jn18WFftD2">Earth Fare in Turkey Creek,
        10903 Parkside Drive, Knoxville</a>. Even if
        you cannot arrive at 7, please join us for a brief discussion, led by
        Don Kraus, CCL regional development director, probably starting about
        7:30.</p>

    <p><b>IMPORTANT. August News Item.</b> A Climate Advocate Training
      workshop will be offered by the Greater Knoxville Chapter of the
      Citizens’ Climate Lobby on Saturday, August 12, 9:00 am – 12 noon, on
      the University of Tennessee Agricultural Campus,
      <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/J5JxqUWw21A2">2500 EJ Chapman Drive</a>,
      Biosystems Engineering and Soil Sciences Bldg., Room 268. The session is
      free and will teach citizens the intricacies of building political will
      and affecting change in positive, constructive ways. Citizens’ Climate
      Lobby (CCL) has a unique approach of achieving change through building
      positive, respectful relationships with lawmakers and focusing on
      specific market-based, consumer-friendly solutions that have received
      support from conservatives and liberals alike. The workshop will include
      a mini-lobbying training.</p>
